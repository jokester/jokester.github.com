## My considerations


- Functionality
    - Visitors tracking with / without JavaScript
        - [piwik faq: track without JS](https://piwik.org/faq/new-to-piwik/faq_63/)
    - Geo locations, etc
- GFW for visitors in China mainland
- Reputation for any service provider
- Cost of keeping it running, either use some external service or run it with my own H/W.
    - footpoint, updates, etc

Piwik seems good for my purpose.
