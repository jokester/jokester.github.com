cssh (cluster ssh) enables one to operate multiple ssh simultaneously.

One package:

    % sudo pacman -S clusterssh

3 lines of configuration in `~/.csshrc` (the hostnames are specified in ~/.ssh/config):

    clusters = exp lab
    exp = exp01 exp02 exp03 exp04 exp05 exp06 exp07 exp08 exp09 exp10
    lab = exp itigo

And I got this with `cssh lab` command:

The input in left-top window is duplicated and sent to all other terminals.
