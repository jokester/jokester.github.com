#### TL;NR

A data URI is a URI that encodes bytes + content-type:

- BASE64 encoded binary data (exception exists)
- MIME type
- no more metadata such like filename

It can be used instead of real file.

A full definition at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme).

#### Example

External links in this site are followed by a icon like [this](http://external.site/).
This is implemented with a data URI in CSS.

Part of
[.sass stylesheet](https://github.com/jokester/jokester.github.io/blob/source/content/css/style.sass)
is like:

~~~ css
a[href^="http://"]:after, a[href^="https://"]:after
  content: " " url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0 ... ORK5CYII=)
~~~

- (binary) images as data URI are slow, especially for mobile clients
- consider to use [CSS sprites](http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/) instead

[Data URI Performance: Don't Blame it on Base64](http://www.mobify.com/blog/base64-does-not-impact-data-uri-performance/)

- SVG image can be included in data URI, either BASE64 encoded or not
- encoded and not-encoded groups performed almost equally, and are still much slower than no-svg group
- so BASE64 may not be the bottleneck
- resource scheduling of data URIs is suspicious
- examined with **real user monitoring** / **RUM**
    - monitor real usage of actual user
    - "passive monitoring"
